## Overview

**Unity AI Assistant** is a Unity Editor extension developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis in cooperation with Capgemini Germany.  
It integrates large language models (LLMs) into the Unity Editor to allow the creation of Unity objects, components, and scripts based on natural language prompts.  
The tool streamlines repetitive development tasks and supports Unity developers with intelligent code and object generation.

> ðŸ§  Powered by OpenAI's GPT API  
> ðŸ§° Built for Unity 2022.3 (LTS)

## Example Prompts

- `"Create a flying enemy script that follows the player"`
- `"Add a blue cube with rigidbody and box collider"`
- `"Apply a sci-fi color palette to the scene"`

---

## Limitations

- Requires active internet connection and valid OpenAI API key
- Prompt output may occasionally require manual adjustment
- Designed for prototyping and support â€“ not intended to fully replace manual scripting
